A website to record tournaments such as leagues and track the leaderboards

# Tournaments
For my Databases 1 exam. Just a sketch, not a production version.

Explore the website down below!

[basidati.epizy.com/tournaments.php](http://basidati.epizy.com/tournaments.php)

It features nested queries to go deep into the database just with a few mouse clicks.

It also has manually (crazily) managed trash control, which means that deleted games/tournaments can be recovered after they are deleted


I'll be very happy to merge your pull requests that add new features, or link to them in a section here!

Interesting features to add would be support for more types of tournaments, suth as direct elimination ones.
Right now only games such as Leagues are supported.
